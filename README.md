# STAR-FALL

This project is an RPG game built with Phaser 3, a JavaScript game framework designed to create 2D games. The user can collect coins which depicts star live to get score , without touching the bullets fired.

## Game Design Documentation

The Star-fall design process started with the idea of creating a simple and beautiful RPG.
I got inspired by the RPG classic the supermario. Thanks to opengameart.org for posting all of these amazing sprites and tiles used in the game.
 
I started by creating a platform game, with a movable character on a static window, that can jump and collect entities.
 
The game‚Äôs entire map was built with Tiled on a 32 x 32 collection other than the cowboy that was built on 45 x 44 of squares.
 
First I created player and coins to get scores, then I added the bullet so the player will have some obstacles to run from.
 
Every player has to choose a name and submit your score at the end of the game for it to display on the leaderboard.
